The task:

Please create a *small* Vue.js or Nuxt.js application on Github.

Please use axios to fetch data from https://www.json-generator.com/ (or any other existing, public API endpoint in a JSON format). You can use json-generator to create any type of data that you like.

Once retrieved, some portion of the data should be passed via Props to a child component.

Please create one additional 'enhancement' of your choice. For example, if you'd like to show off your CSS abilities, style the front end. If you'd like to demonstrate some data visualiztion, display the data in a simple chart. If you'd like to have the 'user' interact with the data, please create a vuex store that mutates the original API data.
